# The Gemini protocol

Gemini is an alternative Internet protocol designed to offer a simple, lightweight and privacy-respecting browsing experience. Situated between Gopher and the modern Web, Gemini eliminates the excessive complexity of today's web while remaining practical and accessible.

## Key features
* Minimalist protocol with no JavaScript or tracking
* Simple document format (gemtext)
* Fast loading and low bandwidth consumption
* Focus on content rather than presentation
* Encrypted connections by default (mandatory TLS)

## Access this site via Gemini

## Why Gemini?
The modern web has become heavy, complex and invasive. Gemini represents a return to the essentials: accessible content, simple navigation, and respect for user privacy. It is a space where the protocol itself prevents tracking and over-complexity.
